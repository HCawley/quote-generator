# quote-generator

A simple quote generator using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The user can randomly generate a quote and background photo by clicking on the "Get quote" button.
This then generates a random number between 0-4 and selects the quote and image from the array using the number generated - this is then displayed on the screen.
